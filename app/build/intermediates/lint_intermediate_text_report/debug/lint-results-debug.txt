   Explanation for issues of type "MissingPermission":
   This check scans through your code and libraries and looks at the APIs
   being used, and checks this against the set of permissions required to
   access those APIs. If the code using those APIs is called at runtime, then
   the program will crash.

   Furthermore, for permissions that are revocable (with targetSdkVersion 23),
   client code must also be prepared to handle the calls throwing an exception
   if the user rejects the request for permission at runtime.

/Users/anuragmishra/Desktop/workspace/expencemanagement/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:10: Warning: WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is deprecated (and is not granted) when targeting Android 13+. If you need to write to shared storage, use the MediaStore.createWriteRequest intent. [ScopedStorage]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ScopedStorage":
   Scoped storage is enforced on Android 10+ (or Android 11+ if using
   requestLegacyExternalStorage). In particular, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE will
   no longer provide write access to all files; it will provide the equivalent
   of READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE instead.

   As of Android 13, if you need to query or interact with MediaStore or media
   files on the shared storage, you should be using instead one or more new
   storage permissions:
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_AUDIO

   and then add maxSdkVersion="33" to the older permission. See the developer
   guide for how to do this:
   https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/behavior-changes-13#granula
   r-media-permissions

   The MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can be used to manage all files, but
   it is rarely necessary and most apps on Google Play are not allowed to use
   it. Most apps should instead migrate to use scoped storage. To modify or
   delete files, apps should request write access from the user as described
   at https://goo.gle/android-mediastore-createwriterequest.

   Explanation for issues of type "CutPasteId":
   This lint check looks for cases where you have cut & pasted calls to
   findViewById but have forgotten to update the R.id field. It's possible
   that your code is simply (redundantly) looking up the field repeatedly, but
   lint cannot distinguish that from a case where you for example want to
   initialize fields prev and next and you cut & pasted
   findViewById(R.id.prev) and forgot to update the second initialization to
   R.id.next.

   Explanation for issues of type "NewApi":
   This check scans through all the Android API calls in the application and
   warns about any calls that are not available on all versions targeted by
   this application (according to its minimum SDK attribute in the manifest).

   If you really want to use this API and don't need to support older devices
   just set the minSdkVersion in your build.gradle or AndroidManifest.xml
   files.

   If your code is deliberately accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured
   (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called
   on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with
   the @TargetApi annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such
   as @TargetApi(11), such that this check considers 11 rather than your
   manifest file's minimum SDK as the required API level.

   If you are deliberately setting android: attributes in style definitions,
   make sure you place this in a values-vNN folder in order to avoid running
   into runtime conflicts on certain devices where manufacturers have added
   custom attributes whose ids conflict with the new ones on later platforms.

   Similarly, you can use tools:targetApi="11" in an XML file to indicate that
   the element will only be inflated in an adequate context.

    android:foreground="?android:attr/selectableItemBackground">
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedAttribute":
   This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a
   version newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with
   the minSdkVersion attribute).

   This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute.
   However, if the attribute is important to the appearance or functionality
   of your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to
   achieve the same result with only available attributes, and then you can
   optionally create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be
   used on API NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer
   attribute.

   Note: This check does not only apply to attributes. For example, some tags
   can be unused too, such as the new <tag> element in layouts introduced in
   API 21.

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

   Explanation for issues of type "PermissionImpliesUnsupportedChromeOsHardware":
   The <uses-permission> element should not require a permission that implies
   an unsupported large screen hardware feature. Google Play assumes that
   certain hardware related permissions indicate that the underlying hardware
   features are required by default. To fix the issue, consider declaring the
   corresponding <uses-feature> element with required="false" attribute.

   Explanation for issues of type "UnspecifiedRegisterReceiverFlag":
   A future platform release will require all receivers registering for
   non-system broadcasts to include a flag indicating the receiver's exported
   state. Apps registering for non-system broadcasts should use the
   ContextCompat#registerReceiver APIs with flags set to either
   RECEIVER_EXPORTED or RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED.

   If you are not expecting broadcasts from other apps on the device, register
   your receiver with RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED to protect your receiver on all
   platform releases.

        notifyDataSetChanged()
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "NotifyDataSetChanged":
   The RecyclerView adapter's onNotifyDataSetChanged method does not specify
   what about the data set has changed, forcing any observers to assume that
   all existing items and structure may no longer be valid. `LayoutManager`s
   will be forced to fully rebind and relayout all visible views.

        @Volatile
        ^

   Explanation for issues of type "StaticFieldLeak":
   A static field will leak contexts.

   Non-static inner classes have an implicit reference to their outer class.
   If that outer class is for example a Fragment or Activity, then this
   reference means that the long-running handler/loader/task will hold a
   reference to the activity which prevents it from getting garbage
   collected.

   Similarly, direct field references to activities and fragments from these
   longer running instances can cause leaks.

   ViewModel classes should never point to Views or non-application Contexts.

/Users/anuragmishra/Desktop/workspace/expencemanagement/app/src/main/res/layout/item_merchant_group.xml:115: Warning: This tag and its children can be replaced by one <TextView/> and a compound drawable [UseCompoundDrawables]
                <LinearLayout
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UseCompoundDrawables":
   A LinearLayout which contains an ImageView and a TextView can be more
   efficiently handled as a compound drawable (a single TextView, using the
   drawableTop, drawableLeft, drawableRight and/or drawableBottom attributes
   to draw one or more images adjacent to the text).

   If the two widgets are offset from each other with margins, this can be
   replaced with a drawablePadding attribute.

   There's a lint quickfix to perform this conversion in the Eclipse plugin.

   Explanation for issues of type "VectorPath":
   Using long vector paths is bad for performance. There are several ways to
   make the pathData shorter:
   * Using less precision
   * Removing some minor details
   * Using the Android Studio vector conversion tool
   * Rasterizing the image (converting to PNG)

            <LinearLayout
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DisableBaselineAlignment":
   When a LinearLayout is used to distribute the space proportionally between
   nested layouts, the baseline alignment property should be turned off to
   make the layout computation faster.

            android:layout_weight="1"
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "NestedWeights":
   Layout weights require a widget to be measured twice. When a LinearLayout
   with non-zero weights is nested inside another LinearLayout with non-zero
   weights, then the number of measurements increase exponentially.

    android:background="@color/surface"
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "Overdraw":
   If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a
   custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme
   background will be painted first, only to have your custom background
   completely cover it; this is called "overdraw".

   NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated
   with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it's currently
   doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can
   incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then
   wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.

   If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should
   consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using
   that theme instead of a root element background.

   Of course it's possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you
   want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better
   performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that
   resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.

           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UselessParent":
   A layout with children that has no siblings, is not a scrollview or a root
   layout, and does not have a background, can be removed and have its
   children moved directly into the parent for a flatter and more efficient
   layout hierarchy.

                           ~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "TypographyEllipsis":
   You can replace the string "..." with a dedicated ellipsis character,
   ellipsis character (u2026, &#8230;). This can help make the text more
   readable.

    override fun onTouchEvent(e: MotionEvent): Boolean {
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ClickableViewAccessibility":
   If a View that overrides onTouchEvent or uses an OnTouchListener does not
   also implement performClick and call it when clicks are detected, the View
   may not handle accessibility actions properly. Logic handling the click
   actions should ideally be placed in View#performClick as some accessibility
   services invoke performClick when a click action should occur.

   Explanation for issues of type "ContentDescription":
   Non-textual widgets like ImageViews and ImageButtons should use the
   contentDescription attribute to specify a textual description of the widget
   such that screen readers and other accessibility tools can adequately
   describe the user interface.

   Note that elements in application screens that are purely decorative and do
   not provide any content or enable a user action should not have
   accessibility content descriptions. In this case, set their descriptions to
   @null. If your app's minSdkVersion is 16 or higher, you can instead set
   these graphical elements' android:importantForAccessibility attributes to
   no.

   Note that for text fields, you should not set both the hint and the
   contentDescription attributes since the hint will never be shown. Just set
   the hint.

/Users/anuragmishra/Desktop/workspace/expencemanagement/app/src/main/res/layout/dialog_quick_add_expense.xml:62: Warning: Missing accessibility label: provide either a view with an android:labelFor that references this view or provide an android:hint [LabelFor]
        <AutoCompleteTextView
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "LabelFor":
   Editable text fields should provide an android:hint or, provided your
   minSdkVersion is at least 17, they may be referenced by a view with a
   android:labelFor attribute.

   When using android:labelFor, be sure to provide an android:text or an
   android:contentDescription.

   If your view is labeled but by a label in a different layout which includes
   this one, just suppress this warning from lint.

   Explanation for issues of type "SetTextI18n":
   When calling TextView#setText
   * Never call Number#toString() to format numbers; it will not handle
   fraction separators and locale-specific digits properly. Consider using
   String#format with proper format specifications (%d or %f) instead.
   * Do not pass a string literal (e.g. "Hello") to display text. Hardcoded
   text can not be properly translated to other languages. Consider using
   Android resource strings instead.
   * Do not build messages by concatenating text chunks. Such messages can not
   be properly translated.

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.

/Users/anuragmishra/Desktop/workspace/expencemanagement/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml: Warning: The project references RTL attributes, but does not explicitly enable or disable RTL support with android:supportsRtl in the manifest [RtlEnabled]

   Explanation for issues of type "RtlEnabled":
   To enable right-to-left support, when running on API 17 and higher, you
   must set the android:supportsRtl attribute in the manifest <application>
   element.

   If you have started adding RTL attributes, but have not yet finished the
   migration, you can set the attribute to false to satisfy this lint check.
