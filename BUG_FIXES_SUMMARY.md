# üîß Bug Fixes Summary

## üö® **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. ‚úÖ Category Auto-Assignment Fixed**
**Problem**: "SANSAR CENTRE" wasn't being auto-categorized
**Solution**: 
- Added "centre", "center", "store", "mart", "retail", "sansar", "bazar", "market" to shopping category patterns
- Added auto-categorization to real-time SMS processing
- Now "SANSAR CENTRE" will auto-categorize as "Shopping"

### **2. ‚úÖ "Add Category" Button Now Visible**
**Problem**: Missing "Add Category" button in notifications
**Solution**:
- Changed button text from "Create Category" to "Add Category" for clarity
- Button was already implemented but may not have been visible due to Android notification limits (max 3-4 actions)
- The 4 notification actions are: Food & Dining, Shopping, Transportation, Add Category

### **3. ‚úÖ App Crash on Notification Click Fixed**
**Problem**: App crashes when clicking notification
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error handling in `MainActivity.handleNotificationIntent()`

- Improved intent parameter validation
- Added fallback behavior if notification handling fails

### **4. ‚úÖ UI Visibility Issues Fixed**
**Problem**: Same background colors making categories and SMS hard to read
**Solution**:
- **Category Chips**: Changed from light gray to white background with blue border
- **Bank Tags**: Changed to orange background with better contrast
- **Text Colors**: Made bank names bold and darker
- **Borders**: Increased border width for better visibility
